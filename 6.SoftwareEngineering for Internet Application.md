###Basic
####introduction
* You're also going to learn about the stateless and anonymous protocol that makes Web development different from classical inter-computer application development. You'll learn why the relational database management system is key to controlling the concurrency problem that arises from multiple simultaneous users. You'll develop software to read and write Extensible Markup Language (XML).

####Old-Style Communications Protocols
* In a traditional communications protocol, Computer Program A opens a connection to Computer Program B. Both programs run continuously for the duration of the communication. This makes it easy for Program B to remember what Program A has said already. Program B can build up state in its memory. The memory can in fact contain a complete log of everything that has come over the wire from Program A.
* In a traditional stateful communications protocol, two programs running on two separate computers establish a connection and proceed to use that connection for as long as necessary, typically until one of the programs terminates.

    versioning of content 内容版本
    whether an item of content is a reply to, a comment on, or an attachment to some other item
    an item of content 是不是已经被审批通过了？
    to whom may the content be shown? is it only for members of a group，a particular user? or as they say in France
    who has the right to edit the content?
    who has the right to change who has the right to view or edit?
    who has the right to comment on an item? who must reviews comments that have been posted before the go live?
    内容时延：什么时候上线，什么时候到期
    内容质量和重要度：应该对用户高亮提示吗？只有用户毕业之后才展示吗？
    内容的全文索引是什么？
    内容的综述，描述，关键词
    who authored or contributed on item, with a distinction among published-authored,group-authored,
    and user-authored stuff
    who should be notifiled via email when a comment on or response to an item is posted
    whether a content item is realated of high interest by a user or low/no interest;given these stats,
    this implies the ability to pick out "new content that is likely to User #17"(depends on text processing software that can compute document similarity)

#### User/Content map
    * User #21 contributed comments #37 on Article #521
    * User #192 asked Question #152
    * User #451 posted Answer #3 to Question #894
    * User #8923 has read Article #452
    * User #8923 is interested in being alerted when an answer to Question #9213

####User Regitstration and management
    * create table users(
        user_id                 integer primary key,
        first_name              varchar(50),
        last_name               varchar(50) not null,
        email                   varchar(100) not null unique,
        -- we encrypt passwords using operating system crypt function
        password                varchar(30) not null,
        regitstration_date      timestamp(0)
    )
    * create table users(
        user_id                 integer primary key,
        first_name              varchar(50),
        last_name               varchar(50) not null,
        email                   varchar(100) not null unique,
        -- we encrypt passwords using operating system crypt function
        password                varchar(30) not null,
        regitstration_date      timestamp(0)
    )

    * create table users (
	    user_id			integer primary key,
	    first_names		varchar(50),
	    last_name		varchar(50) not null,
	    email			varchar(100) not null unique,
	    password		varchar(30) not null,
	    registration_date	timestamp(0)
    );

    * create table users_extra_info(
        user_info_id            interger primary key,
        user_id                 not null reference users,
        field_name              varchar(100) not null,
        field_type              varchar(100) not null,
        -- one of the three columns below will be non-NULL
	    varchar_value	varchar(4000),
	    blob_value	blob,
	    date_value	timestamp(0),
	    check ( not (varchar_value is null and 
                    blob_value is null and
		            date_value is null))
	    -- in a real system, you'd probably have additional columns
	    -- to store when each row was inserted and by whom
    )
    -- make it
    create index users_extra_info_by_user on users_extra_info(user_id);
