###Basic
####introduction
* You're also going to learn about the stateless and anonymous protocol that makes Web development different from classical inter-computer application development. You'll learn why the relational database management system is key to controlling the concurrency problem that arises from multiple simultaneous users. You'll develop software to read and write Extensible Markup Language (XML).

####Old-Style Communications Protocols
* In a traditional communications protocol, Computer Program A opens a connection to Computer Program B. Both programs run continuously for the duration of the communication. This makes it easy for Program B to remember what Program A has said already. Program B can build up state in its memory. The memory can in fact contain a complete log of everything that has come over the wire from Program A.
* In a traditional stateful communications protocol, two programs running on two separate computers establish a connection and proceed to use that connection for as long as necessary, typically until one of the programs terminates.

    versioning of content 内容版本
    whether an item of content is a reply to, a comment on, or an attachment to some other item
    an item of content 是不是已经被审批通过了？
    to whom may the content be shown? is it only for members of a group，a particular user? or as they say in France
    who has the right to edit the content?
    who has the right to change who has the right to view or edit?
    who has the right to comment on an item? who must reviews comments that have been posted before the go live?
    内容时延：什么时候上线，什么时候到期
    内容质量和重要度：应该对用户高亮提示吗？只有用户毕业之后才展示吗？
    内容的全文索引是什么？
    内容的综述，描述，关键词
    who authored or contributed on item, with a distinction among published-authored,group-authored,
    and user-authored stuff
    who should be notifiled via email when a comment on or response to an item is posted
    whether a content item is realated of high interest by a user or low/no interest;given these stats,
    this implies the ability to pick out "new content that is likely to User #17"(depends on text processing software that can compute document similarity)

#### User/Content map
    * User #21 contributed comments #37 on Article #521
    * User #192 asked Question #152
    * User #451 posted Answer #3 to Question #894
    * User #8923 has read Article #452
    * User #8923 is interested in being alerted when an answer to Question #9213

####User Regitstration and management
    * create table users(
        user_id                 integer primary key,
        first_name              varchar(50),
        last_name               varchar(50) not null,
        email                   varchar(100) not null unique,
        -- we encrypt passwords using operating system crypt function
        password                varchar(30) not null,
        regitstration_date      timestamp(0)
    )
    * create table users(
        user_id                 integer primary key,
        first_name              varchar(50),
        last_name               varchar(50) not null,
        email                   varchar(100) not null unique,
        -- we encrypt passwords using operating system crypt function
        password                varchar(30) not null,
        regitstration_date      timestamp(0)
    )

    * create table users (
	    user_id			integer primary key,
	    first_names		varchar(50),
	    last_name		varchar(50) not null,
	    email			varchar(100) not null unique,
	    password		varchar(30) not null,
	    registration_date	timestamp(0)
    );

    * create table users_extra_info(
        user_info_id            interger primary key,
        user_id                 not null reference users,
        field_name              varchar(100) not null,
        field_type              varchar(100) not null,
        -- one of the three columns below will be non-NULL
	    varchar_value	varchar(4000),
	    blob_value	blob,
	    date_value	timestamp(0),
	    check ( not (varchar_value is null and 
                    blob_value is null and
		            date_value is null))
	    -- in a real system, you'd probably have additional columns
	    -- to store when each row was inserted and by whom
    )
    -- make it
    create index users_extra_info_by_user on users_extra_info(user_id);

    select average(varchar_value)
    from users_extra_info
    where field_name = "annual_income"
    create unique index users_extra_info_user_id_field_idx on users_extra_info(user_id,field_name)

####胖表还是瘦表
    * 这是一个工程问题
    * 假如你把所有的都存在了一个表里，例如下面：
        create table my_data(
            key_id          integer,
            field_name      varchar,
            field_type      varchar,
            field_value     varchar
        );
    *   create table address_book(
            address_book_id integer primary key,
            user_id         not null references users,
            first_names	    varchar(30),
            last_name	    varchar(30),
            email		    varchar(100),
            email2		    varchar(100),
            line1		    varchar(100),
            line2		    varchar(100),
            city		    varchar(100),
            state_province  varchar(20)
            postal_code     varchar(20)
            country_code    char(2) references country_code(iso),
            phone_home      varchar(30)
            phone_work      varchar(30)            
            phone_cell      varchar(30)
            phone_other     varchar(30)
            birthdate       date,
            days_in_advance_to_remind   integer,
            date_laste_reminded         date,
            notes            varchar(4000)
        )
    *Skinny表存放不同的分散的数据是非常好的
####User Groups
####Derivable data 获取数据
####Access Control and Approval
####练习1
####Muti-Page Design and Flow
    * A desktop application is generally a complex miasma in which the state of the project is only partially visible. Despite software vendors having added multiple-level Undo commands to many popular desktop programs, the state of those programs remains opaque to users.
    * 一个原则是不要打断用户的返回键
        * 选了一本书
        * 输入一个地址
        * 输入信用卡地址
        * 确认
        * 感谢
####Choosing between GET and posted
    * 大多数人认为选择GET方法是为了让url更美观，其实不是这样的
    * Get意味着你在获取信息，你可以重新提交一个get请求，对后端没有任何影响
    * POST请求意味着你在做一些有副作用的操作，比如插入一行，更新一行数据，发射一个导弹，啊不，删除一行数据，这也就是为什么当你要重新提交一个POSt请求时，你的浏览器提醒你，你确定要发射下一颗导弹么
